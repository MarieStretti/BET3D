# BET3D
## Building Elevation for Turgot map in 3D

## Context
This project takes place in the Web 3D lesson of the TSI course at the [ENSG](www.ensg.eu). 

## Objective
The goal of this project was to extract relief from the Paris Turgot map. As the map is drawn with a perspective, the relief of buildings corresponds to their facades.

## Implemented functionnalities
* a button `zenithView` rendering the Turgot view
* a button `turgotView` rendering the zenithal view
* a radio button `mode3D` rendering the 3D buildings facades with their shadow

## Installation
* Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/MarieStretti/BET3D.git
```
*
